# ‚òï Company Home Page with Flexbox
Company Home Page with Flexbox is a challenge project from Codecademy's Front End Engineer Career Path. For this project I have created a clone of a local coffee company's website, using Flexbox to design and build the layout. 

The original website for Fabrica Coffee Roasters can be found here: 
www.fabricacoffeeroasters.com.
